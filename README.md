💻 Technologies Used
C++: The core programming language used for app development, utilizing object-oriented programming principles for clean and maintainable code.

Standard Libraries 📚:

ctime for time and date tracking.

vector for managing lists of habits.

string for handling text-based data.

File I/O 💾 (Planned for future versions): Save habit data and progress to files (e.g., JSON or text) for persistent tracking across sessions.

🎯 Challenges Faced
Behavioral Motivation:
Ensuring the right balance of motivation without overwhelming the user was key. We focused on providing positive reinforcement like rewards and progress feedback.

Personalization:
Allowing users to personalize their habits while keeping the interface clean and intuitive was a challenge.

Tracking Accuracy:
Ensuring accurate habit tracking and preventing multiple entries for the same habit in one day was important to maintain data integrity.

Gamification Design:
Designing a rewarding system that keeps users motivated and makes habit-building fun, without feeling too forced or gimmicky.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Data Persistence:
Implementing the ability to save and load user data (habits, progress) from files, so the user's data is retained between sessions.

Advanced Gamification:
Adding achievements, levels, and leaderboards to increase engagement and create a more competitive experience.

Mobile or GUI Version:
Transitioning from a console-based application to a more user-friendly GUI (graphical user interface) or a mobile app for broader accessibility.
